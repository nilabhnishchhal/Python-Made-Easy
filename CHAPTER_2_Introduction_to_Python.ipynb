    "## What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a Free and Open Source, `interpreted`, `high-level`, `general-purpose` programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural) object-oriented, and functional programming. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.\n",

    "  ### Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "When I was choosing the programing language to learn, the criterion to chose from the hundreds of languages was simple. It shall be `easy to learn` & `easy to use` and it should be a `popular language` for coding among programmers. \n",
    "\n",
    "As far as popularity goes, the most popular programming languages for Data Scientists are \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python\n",
    "2. R\n",
    "3. SQL\n",
    "4. C++\n",
    "5. Java\n",
    "6. Matlab\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are starting your programming career or if you want to learn your first programming language, then it is wise to learn one of the mainstream and established programming languages. Hence, the language we shall chose should be the one programming language which fulfills all the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Already mainstream and firmly established in the Software Development industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Top-ranked in the renowned programming languages ranking websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Popularity is increasing or stable and not sharply decreasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. They have a large set of libraries, frameworks, tooling support, and have a large community.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. They are demanding in the job market with a good salary.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Among these above most popular languages, the one language which fits all these criterion and also, the easiest to learn and use is Python. Not only that, python is highly customizable as well as extendable to other platforms. on standalone basis also, its quite powerful language for variety of tasks. Its open source, and widely collaborated. The modules and libraries are freely available and growing by every passing day. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is also extremely capable of data mining, data anlaytics and Machine learning. The programing language capability combined with data analytics modules, make it a potent weapon in every analysts armor. "

    "### Python Origin\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language. Its implementation began in December 1989. Van Rossum continued as Python's lead developer until July 12, 2018, when he announced his \"permanent vacation\" from his responsibilities as Python's Benevolent Dictator For Life, a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker. In January, 2019, active Python core developers elected Brett Cannon, Nick Coghlan, Barry Warsaw, Carol Willing and van Rossum to a five-member \"Steering Council\" to lead the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000 with many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector and support for Unicode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008. It was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible. Many of its major features were backported to Python 2.6.x and 2.7.x version series. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates (at least partially) the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 2.7's end-of-life date was initially set at 2015 then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3. In January 2017, Google announced work on a Python 2.7 to Go transcompiler to improve performance under concurrent workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the way, the language is named after the BBC show “Monty Python’s Flying Circus” and has nothing to do with reptiles. Making references to Monty Python skits in documentation is not only allowed, it is encouraged!\n",

    "### Python as compared to other Programming Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "While working on computers and softwares, you may found lot of my work to be repetitive and yet, time consuming. You would like to automate such work, where you are not adding Value. \n",
    "For example, you may wish to perform a search-and-replace over a large number of text files, or rename and rearrange a bunch of photo files in a complicated way. Perhaps you’d like to write a small custom database, or a specialized GUI application, or a simple game. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re a professional software developer, you may have to work with several C/C++/Java libraries but find the usual write/compile/test/re-compile cycle is too slow. Perhaps you’re writing a test suite for such a library and find writing the testing code a tedious task. Or maybe you’ve written a program that could use an extension language, and you don’t want to design and implement a whole new language for your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could write a Unix shell script or Windows batch files for some of these tasks, but shell scripts are best at moving around files and changing text data, not well-suited for GUI applications or games. You could write a C/C++/Java program, but it can take a lot of development time to get even a first-draft program. Python is simpler to use, available on Windows, Mac OS X, and Unix operating systems, and will help you get the job done more quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is simple to use, but it is a real programming language, offering much more structure and support for large programs than shell scripts or batch files can offer. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, Python also offers much more error checking than C, and, being a very-high-level language, it has high-level data types built in, such as flexible arrays and dictionaries. Because of its more general data types Python is applicable to a much larger problem domain than Awk or even Perl, yet many things are at least as easy in Python as in those languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python allows you to split your program into modules that can be reused in other Python programs. It comes with a large collection of standard modules that you can use as the basis of your programs — or as examples to start learning to program in Python. Some of these modules provide things like file I/O, system calls, sockets, and even interfaces to graphical user interface toolkits like Tk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted language, which can save you considerable time during program development because no compilation and linking is necessary. The interpreter can be used interactively, which makes it easy to experiment with features of the language, to write throw-away programs, or to test functions during bottom-up program development. It is also a handy desk calculator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python enables programs to be written compactly and readably. Programs written in Python are typically much shorter than equivalent C, C++, or Java programs, for several reasons:\n",
    "+ the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;\n",
    "+ statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets;\n",
    "+ no variable or argument declarations are necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is extensible: if you know how to program in C it is easy to add a new built-in function or module to the interpreter, either to perform critical operations at maximum speed, or to link Python programs to libraries that may only be available in binary form (such as a vendor-specific graphics library). Once you are really hooked, you can link the Python interpreter into an application written in C and use it as an extension or command language for that application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, do not worry a bit if many of the terms used above are unheard or not clear as of yet. We will learn them as and when we require to use them. This is just a summary comparison of various programming languages to assure that we are on the right track here. "

    "### Philisophy of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The language's core philosophy is summarized in the document The [Zen of Python (PEP 20)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_of_Python), which includes aphorisms such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Beautiful is better than ugly\n",
    "+ Explicit is better than implicit\n",
    "+ Simple is better than complex\n",
    "+ Complex is better than complicated\n",
    "+ Readability counts\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantage of Python over other languages\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is as simple as \"Disciplined English\". What I mean here is, its not like an alien language, which a normal person can not understand. But at the same time, some discipline is required.\n",
    "Reading a python code feels like reading english. Simplicity is one of the core strengths of Python. Hence, it allows to focus more on the solution, rather than syntax of the coding language. \n",
    "Is is not something to cheer about?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Easy to learn\n",
    "\n",
    "As you will see further in the book, Python is an extremely easy language to get started with. It's syntax is extremely simple. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Free and Open Source\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is FREE. As we will see in next few pages, where we download and install Python, its Completely Free. There are no hidden charges for usage or distribution of your work. Python is an example of a FLOSS (Free/Libré and Open Source Software). In simple terms, you can freely distribute copies of this software, read its source code, make changes to it, and use pieces of it in new free programs. FLOSS is based on the concept of a community which shares knowledge. This is one of the reasons why Python is so good - it has been created and is constantly improved by a community who just want to see a better Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### High Level Language\n",
    "\n",
    "A high level programing language is one, in which you need not worry about many details, which you need to, when using a low level programming language. \n",
    "for example, in Python, you need not worry about low-level details such as managing the memory used by your program. \n",
    "In simple terms, Low-Level languages are closer to the hardware than are high-level programming languages, which are closer to human languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Portable\n",
    "\n",
    "Portable means, Python can be used on different kind of machines, independent of hardware or operating system constraints. Due to its Open Source nature, it has been ported to many platforms. Python can be used on Windows, GNU/Linux, Macintosh, Solaris, Palm OS, PlayStation, Sharp Zaurus, Windows CE and PocketPC!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpreted\n",
    "\n",
    "When you write a program in a language like C or C++, it is converted from the source language. i.e C or C++ code is converted to Binary codes (0s and 1s), because that is the language computer understands. This process is done using a compiler. When the program is run, the linker/loader software copies the program to memory, and starts running it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python, on the other hand, doesn't need the compilation to Binary. The program is run directly from the source code. Internally, Python converts the source code into an intermediate form called bytecodes and then translates this into the native language of the computer and then runs it.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does this help You?\n",
    "\n",
    "+ you don't have to worry about compiling the program.\n",
    "+ No need to worry if the proper libraries are linked and loaded or not. \n",
    "+ This makes the Python Programs much more portable. i.e simply copying the program on another computer works seamlessly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Being the fastest growing programming language in 2020, there is no scarcity of interpreters for Python. let's get a brief understanding of an interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`What is an Interpreter?`**\n",
    "\n",
    "By definition, an interpreter is a type of computer program that directly executes the instructions written in some programming or scripting language. By direct execution, we mean that it doesn't require the instructions to be compiled into a machine language program first.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Object Oriented\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports procedure-oriented programming as well as object-oriented programming. In procedure-oriented languages, the program is built around procedures or functions which are nothing but reusable pieces of programs. In object-oriented languages, the program is built around objects which combine data and functionality. Python has a very powerful but simplistic way of doing OOP, especially when compared to big languages like C++ or Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extensible\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need a critical piece of code to run very fast or want to have some piece of algorithm not to be open, you can code that part of your program in C or C++ and then use it from your Python program.\n",
    "Python is easily extensible with C/C++/Java code, and easily embeddable in applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Embeddable\n",
    "\n",
    "Python can be embedded within C/C++ programs to give scripting capabilities for program's users.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extensive Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's large standard library, commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths, provides tools suited to many tasks. For Internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as MIME and HTTP are supported. It includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to relational databases, generating pseudorandom numbers, arithmetic with arbitrary precision decimals, manipulating regular expressions, and unit testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of March 2018, the Python Package Index (PyPI), the official repository for third-party Python software, contains over 130,000 packages with a wide range of functionality, including:\n",

    "### Python for Beginners!\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is the most apt language for beginners with minimum or nil exposure to computer programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is still common to start students with a procedural and statically typed language such as Pascal, C, or a subset of C++ or Java. Students may be better served by learning Python as their first language. Python has a very simple and consistent syntax and a large standard library and, most importantly, using Python in a beginning programming course lets students concentrate on important programming skills such as problem decomposition and data type design. With Python, students can be quickly introduced to basic concepts such as loops and procedures. They can probably even work with user-defined objects in their very first course.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a student who has never programmed before, using a statically typed language seems unnatural. It presents additional complexity that the student must master and slows the pace of the course. The students are trying to learn to think like a computer, decompose problems, design consistent interfaces, and encapsulate data. While learning to use a statically typed language is important in the long term, it is not necessarily the best topic to address in the students' first programming course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many other aspects of Python make it a good first language. Like Java, Python has a large standard library so that students can be assigned programming projects very early in the course that do something. Assignments aren't restricted to the standard four-function calculator and check balancing programs. By using the standard library, students can gain the satisfaction of working on realistic applications as they learn the fundamentals of programming. Using the standard library also teaches students about code reuse. Third-party modules such as PyGame are also helpful in extending the students' reach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's interactive interpreter enables students to test language features while they're programming. They can keep a window with the interpreter running while they enter their program's source in another window."

    "## Python Version\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python 2\n",
    "Published in late 2000, Python 2 signaled a more transparent and inclusive language development process than earlier versions of Python with the implementation of PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal), a technical specification that either provides information to Python community members or describes a new feature of the language.\n",
    "Additionally, Python 2 included many more programmatic features including a cycle-detecting garbage collector to automate memory management, increased Unicode support to standardize characters, and list comprehensions to create a list based on existing lists. As Python 2 continued to develop, more features were added, including unifying Python's types and classes into one hierarchy in Python version 2.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python 2.7\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the 2008 release of Python 3.0, Python 2.7 was published on July 3, 2010 and planned as the last of the 2.x releases. The intention behind Python 2.7 was to make it easier for Python 2.x users to port features over to Python 3 by providing some measure of compatibility between the two. This compatibility support included enhanced modules for version 2.7 like unittest to support test automation, argparse for parsing command-line options, and more convenient classes in collections.\n",
    "Because of Python 2.7’s unique position as a version in between the earlier iterations of Python 2 and Python 3.0, it has persisted as a very popular choice for programmers due to its compatibility with many robust libraries. When we talk about Python 2 today, we are typically referring to the Python 2.7 release as that is the most frequently used version.\n",
    "Python 2.7, however, is considered to be a legacy language and its continued development, which today mostly consists of bug fixes, will cease completely in 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python 3\n",
    "Python 3 is regarded as the future of Python and is the version of the language that is currently in development. A major overhaul, Python 3 was released in late 2008 to address and amend intrinsic design flaws of previous versions of the language. The focus of Python 3 development was to clean up the codebase and remove redundancy, making it clear that there was only one way to perform a given task.\n",
    "Major modifications to Python 3.0 included changing the print statement into a built-in function, improve the way integers are divided, and providing more Unicode support.\n",
    "At first, Python 3 was slowly adopted due to the language not being backwards compatible with Python 2, requiring people to make a decision as to which version of the language to use. Additionally, many package libraries were only available for Python 2, but as the development team behind Python 3 has reiterated that there is an end of life for Python 2 support, more libraries have been ported to Python 3. The increased adoption of Python 3 can be shown by the number of Python packages that now provide Python 3 support, which at the time of writing includes 339 of the 360 most popular Python packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Differences\n",
    "While Python 2.7 and Python 3 share many similar capabilities, they should not be thought of as entirely interchangeable. Though you can write good code and useful programs in either version, it is worth understanding that there will be some considerable differences in code syntax and handling."

    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook extends the console-based approach to interactive computing in a qualitatively new direction, providing a web-based application suitable for capturing the whole computation process: developing, documenting, and executing code, as well as communicating the results. The Jupyter notebook combines two components:\n",
    "\n",
    "A web application: a browser-based tool for interactive authoring of documents which combine explanatory text, mathematics, computations and their rich media output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook documents: a representation of all content visible in the web application, including inputs and outputs of the computations, explanatory text, mathematics, images, and rich media representations of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main features of the web application\n",
    "In-browser editing for code, with automatic syntax highlighting, indentation, and tab completion/introspection.\n",
    "The ability to execute code from the browser, with the results of computations attached to the code which generated them.\n",
    "Displaying the result of computation using rich media representations, such as HTML, LaTeX, PNG, SVG, etc. For example, publication-quality figures rendered by the matplotlib library, can be included inline.\n",
    "In-browser editing for rich text using the Markdown markup language, which can provide commentary for the code, is not limited to plain text.\n",
    "The ability to easily include mathematical notation within markdown cells using LaTeX, and rendered natively by MathJax.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook documents\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook documents contains the inputs and outputs of a interactive session as well as additional text that accompanies the code but is not meant for execution. In this way, notebook files can serve as a complete computational record of a session, interleaving executable code with explanatory text, mathematics, and rich representations of resulting objects. These documents are internally JSON files and are saved with the .ipynb extension. Since JSON is a plain text format, they can be version-controlled and shared with colleagues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks may be exported to a range of static formats, including HTML (for example, for blog posts), reStructuredText, LaTeX, PDF, and slide shows, via the nbconvert command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, any .ipynb notebook document available from a public URL can be shared via the Jupyter Notebook Viewer (nbviewer). This service loads the notebook document from the URL and renders it as a static web page. The results may thus be shared with a colleague, or as a public blog post, without other users needing to install the Jupyter notebook themselves. In effect, nbviewer is simply nbconvert as a web service, so you can do your own static conversions with nbconvert, without relying on nbviewer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Starting the notebook server\n",
    "\n",
    "You can start running a notebook server from the command line using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "This will print some information about the notebook server in your console, and open a web browser to the URL of the web application (by default, http://127.0.0.1:8888).\n",
    "\n",
    "The landing page of the Jupyter notebook web application, the dashboard, shows the notebooks currently available in the notebook directory (by default, the directory from which the notebook server was started).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create new notebooks from the dashboard with the New Notebook button, or open existing ones by clicking on their name. You can also drag and drop .ipynb notebooks and standard .py Python source code files into the notebook list area.\n",
    "\n",
    "When starting a notebook server from the command line, you can also open a particular notebook directly, bypassing the dashboard, with jupyter notebook my_notebook.ipynb. The .ipynb extension is assumed if no extension is given.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are inside an open notebook, the File | Open... menu option will open the dashboard in a new browser tab, to allow you to open another notebook from the notebook directory or to create a new notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "You can start more than one notebook server at the same time, if you want to work on notebooks in different directories. By default the first notebook server starts on port 8888, and later notebook servers search for ports near that one. You can also manually specify the port with the --port option.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a new notebook document\n",
    "\n",
    "A new notebook may be created at any time, either from the dashboard, or using the :menuselection:`File --> New` menu option from within an active notebook. The new notebook is created within the same directory and will open in a new browser tab. It will also be reflected as a new entry in the notebook list on the dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Opening notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "An open notebook has exactly one interactive session connected to a kernel, which will execute code sent by the user and communicate back results. This kernel remains active if the web browser window is closed, and reopening the same notebook from the dashboard will reconnect the web application to the same kernel. In the dashboard, notebooks with an active kernel have a Shutdown button next to them, whereas notebooks without an active kernel have a Delete button in its place.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook user interface\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create a new notebook document, you will be presented with the notebook name, a menu bar, a toolbar and an empty code cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "![notebook blank](blank-notebook-ui.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notebook name:** The name displayed at the top of the page, next to the Jupyter logo, reflects the name of the .ipynb file. Clicking on the notebook name brings up a dialog which allows you to rename it. Thus, renaming a notebook from \"Untitled0\" to \"My first notebook\" in the browser, renames the Untitled0.ipynb file to My first notebook.ipynb.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Menu bar:** The menu bar presents different options that may be used to manipulate the way the notebook functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Toolbar:** The tool bar gives a quick way of performing the most-used operations within the notebook, by clicking on an icon.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code cell:** the default type of cell; read on for an explanation of cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure of a notebook document\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook consists of a sequence of cells. A cell is a multiline text input field, and its contents can be executed by using Shift-Enter, or by clicking either the \"Play\" button the toolbar, or :guilabel:`Cell`, :guilabel:`Run` in the menu bar. The execution behavior of a cell is determined by the cell's type. There are three types of cells: code cells, markdown cells, and raw cells. Every cell starts off being a code cell, but its type can be changed by using a drop-down on the toolbar (which will be \"Code\", initially), or via :ref:`keyboard shortcuts <keyboard-shortcuts>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on the different things you can do in a notebook, see the collection of examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code cells\n",
    "\n",
    "A code cell allows you to edit and write new code, with full syntax highlighting and tab completion. The programming language you use depends on the kernel, and the default kernel (IPython) runs Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a code cell is executed, code that it contains is sent to the kernel associated with the notebook. The results that are returned from this computation are then displayed in the notebook as the cell's output. The output is not limited to text, with many other possible forms of output are also possible, including matplotlib figures and HTML tables (as used, for example, in the pandas data analysis package). This is known as IPython's rich display capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Markdown cells\n",
    "\n",
    "You can document the computational process in a literate way, alternating descriptive text with code, using rich text. In IPython this is accomplished by marking up text with the Markdown language. The corresponding cells are called Markdown cells. The Markdown language provides a simple way to perform this text markup, that is, to specify which parts of the text should be emphasized (italics), bold, form lists, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to provide structure for your document, you can use markdown headings. Markdown headings consist of 1 to 6 hash # signs # followed by a space and the title of your section. The markdown heading will be converted to a clickable link for a section of the notebook. It is also used as a hint when exporting to other document formats, like PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a Markdown cell is executed, the Markdown code is converted into the corresponding formatted rich text. Markdown allows arbitrary HTML code for formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within Markdown cells, you can also include mathematics in a straightforward way, using standard LaTeX notation: $...$ for inline mathematics and $$...$$ for displayed mathematics. When the Markdown cell is executed, the LaTeX portions are automatically rendered in the HTML output as equations with high quality typography. This is made possible by MathJax, which supports a large subset of LaTeX functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Raw cells\n",
    "\n",
    "Raw cells provide a place in which you can write output directly. Raw cells are not evaluated by the notebook. When passed through nbconvert_, raw cells arrive in the destination format unmodified. For example, you can type full LaTeX into a raw cell, which will only be rendered by LaTeX after conversion by nbconvert.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal workflow in a notebook is, then, quite similar to a standard IPython session, with the difference that you can edit cells in-place multiple times until you obtain the desired results, rather than having to rerun separate scripts with the %run magic command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, you will work on a computational problem in pieces, organizing related ideas into cells and moving forward once previous parts work correctly. This is much more convenient for interactive exploration than breaking up a computation into scripts that must be executed together, as was previously necessary, especially if parts of them take a long time to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "To interrupt a calculation which is taking too long, use the :guilabel:`Kernel`, :guilabel:`Interrupt` menu option, or the i,i keyboard shortcut. Similarly, to restart the whole computational process, use the :guilabel:`Kernel`, :guilabel:`Restart` menu option or 0,0 shortcut.\n",
    "\n",
    "A notebook may be downloaded as a .ipynb file or converted to a number of other formats using the menu option :guilabel:`File`, :guilabel:`Download as`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keyboard shortcuts\n",
    "\n",
    "All actions in the notebook can be performed with the mouse, but keyboard shortcuts are also available for the most common ones. The essential shortcuts to remember are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Shift-Enter:** run cell\n",
    "\n",
    "Execute the current cell, show any output, and jump to the next cell below. If Shift-Enter is invoked on the last cell, it makes a new cell below. This is equivalent to clicking the :guilabel:`Cell`, :guilabel:`Run` menu item, or the Play button in the toolbar.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Esc:** Command mode\n",
    "\n",
    "In command mode, you can navigate around the notebook using keyboard shortcuts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Enter:** Edit mode\n",
    "\n",
    "In edit mode, you can edit text in cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "**H** (When in Command Mode) : Gives a list of all other Keyboard Shortcuts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plotting\n",
    "\n",
    "One major feature of the Jupyter notebook is the ability to display plots that are the output of running code cells. The IPython kernel is designed to work seamlessly with the matplotlib_ plotting library to provide this functionality. Specific plotting library integration is a feature of the kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "We saw four ways to use Python or run codes in Python. Each comes with its advantages. Also, most of the experienced programmers use all of them, depending on the kind of project they are working or the need of the hour. Let us have a brief comparison for usage. \n",
    "\n",
    "**`Terminal`** window is the starting and most basic way to run python, as we saw earlier. But its certainly not the most elegant way. To write long codes and run here is quite cumbersome, and debugging them in terminal is not an easy task. We will use the terminal very occasionally, for very specific purposes, as and when the need arise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`IPython Qt Console`** is a very lightweight application that largely feels like a terminal, but provides a number of enhancements only possible in a GUI, such as inline figures, proper multiline editing with syntax highlighting, graphical calltips, and more. They can be used as a clean way to test your codes or scripts. The benefits of the console are however also available in the IDE. So when we are using IDE, console kind of looks obsolete. \n",
    "\n",
    "**`Spyder IDE`** is the application most programmers use to write, debug and test run the line of codes. Here we can run the codes either line by line, or club them in a cell and run the entire cell together. We will learn this in detail when we get to use it. Also, we have result printed in front of us, and the graphs as well as the objects are available to be viewed in another window. This is where you will like to work once you get a hand of Python. Its worthwhile to mention that this is not the only IDE for python. There are many other available, but we will use this as this comes as default with Anaconda, and is second to none in terms of functionalities. \n",
    "\n",
    "**`Jupyter Notebook`** is a web-based interactive computing platform. The notebook combines live code, equations, narrative text, visualizations, interactive dashboards and other media. This becomes a very useful tool, when the data being analyzed also needs to be presented (which is the case most of the time). You can write codes, and descriptions, create charts, and give explanations, all in one place. \n",
